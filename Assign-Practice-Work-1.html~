                 <p class="pLineHeight">I am a passionate learner pursuing Masters in Computer Science after having worked for 4+ years in Software Industry. The experience gave me opportunities to work on all layers like front-end, back-end and business logic layer. I had worked on all phases of SDLC through these years. </br>
      I had worked with many reputed US based clients and had direct interactions with them. Application development interests me much. I have production experience on languages like AngularJS, JAVA, HTML, MySQL database and hands-on experience on C++, Oracle PL/SQL, Javascript, PHP.
      My current curriculum in <span class="utd" data-toggle="tooltip" title="University of Texas at Dallas">UTD</span> gave me a visibility to database design, cloud computing, web programming languages. </br>

I love learning new technologies and exploring full stack application development. My academic pursuits have not however occluded my participation from co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. I have participated and won various awards in intramural, inter-college sports and continued the same at Infosys as well. I had also volunteered and organized many events and symposiums in college as well as at Infosys. I am a part of organizations in <span class="utd" data-toggle="tooltip" title="University of Texas at Dallas">UTD</span> as well. These paved a path to improve my inter-personal skills like communication skills, management skills. etc.</br>
		  &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;In addition to being a lead developer, I was coordinating my team as a senior member, mentoring new comers. I believe with all these skills I could mold and fit my myself in different working environments and teams.
